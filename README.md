## React Neighbourhood Map

The 8th project at Udacity. Creating a Google Maps with React and allowing the user to select and look at different places where I live: Tel Aviv, Israel.

## Technology used in this project:

* Google Maps API
* FourSquare API
* Reactjs
* HTML
* CSS


## How to use it

* Node.js has to be installed on your repository before you clone it.
* Once you're done with that, go to the Terminal and write: `npm install`
* Afterwards: `npm start`
* Once you do that, the browser will automatically open a new window and redirect you to the app. In case you're experiencing some problems and it doesn't automatically open a window, simply run `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser and you'll be in.
* Have fun!

* NOTE: This is not running in production build! If you want to do that, simply follow these two steps:
* `npm run build`
* `npm run deploy`
